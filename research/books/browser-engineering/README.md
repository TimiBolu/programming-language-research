# Browser Engineering

This is the code & notes from the [Browser Engineering book](https://browser.engineering).

## Intro

The essence of the web:

- The web is a network of information linked by hyperlinks.
- Information is requested with the HTTP network protocol and structured with the HTML document format.
- Documents are identified by URLs, not by their content, and may be dynamic.
- Web pages can link to auxiliary assets in different formats, including images, videos, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The user uses a User Agent, called a browser, to navigate the web.
- All these building blocks are open, standardized, and free to use or re-use.
