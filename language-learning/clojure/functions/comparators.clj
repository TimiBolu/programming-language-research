;; Resource: https://clojure.org/guides/comparators
;; compare works for many types of values, ordering them in one particular way:
;; - increasing numeric order for numbers;
;; - lexicographic order (aka dictionary order) for strings, symbols, and keywords;
;; - shortest-to-longest order by Clojure vectors, with lexicographic ordering among equal length vectors

;; reverse order
(defn reverse-cmp
  [a b]
  (compare b a))

(sort reverse-cmp [1 2 3 4])

;; using Clojureâ€™s #() notation
(sort #(compare %2 %1) [1 2 3 4])
